    <h3>Brittany McCue Tries HTML/CSS Once Again</h3>
    <p> Hello! I'm Brittany and I am using a Macbook Pro. I studied viscom, interior architecture, and textile design in college and have worked for several e-commerce (mostly home decor related)tech startups in the Bay Area in some creative or administrative capacity. I've decided that I'd like to venture fully into the world of graphic design, as I tend to lend those skills to my work whenever the chance arises. I am living in San Diego temporarily with my mom and our 3 small dogs (and Frenchie and two chihuahuas). I love to illustrate, take classes, thrift, go to flea markets, and crochet!
    </p>
    <p> I've set up my Github account, domain, etc., however it has been difficult to push my changes from Github to my domain. They don't seem to be updating.
